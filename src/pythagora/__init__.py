'''Pythagora is an agent-based modeling package that allows for the construction of experiments to test the impact of
select types of social networks on production and consumption outcomes. Specifically, _Pythagora_ tests how
individuals (agents) in small-world social networks and scale-free social networks (as well as control versions of
these networks) buy and sell new types of pottery based on interactions within their social networks.

Agents in Pythagora have complex social lives: they belong to communities and are connected in social networks both
inside and outside those communities. The purpose of this multidimensional social landscape is to test the impact of
different types of social relationships on what individual agents buy and sell, and how these individual transactions
build over time to create long-term production and consumption trends.

While Pythagora was designed to test popularity changes in pottery styles in the ancient Mediterranean world, it
can be used to test popularity changes for any type of object during any time period.

Pythagora was developed by Sarah T. Wilker, PhD & Annie K. Lamar, PhD.
